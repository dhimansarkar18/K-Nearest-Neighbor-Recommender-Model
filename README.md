![Collage](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/pics/0520_MovieCollage_974.jpg)
# Background

In this KNN Reccomender Model it predicts the top 5 movies simmilar to the input features. This is a similar logic to the models implemented by motion picture streaming services such as AmazonPrime, Netflix, HBO etc. In order to run our model we utilize a dataset including Movie ID, Movie Name, IMDB Rating and Genre.

# Dataset

The data set can be downloaded via github: 
("https://github.com/ArinB/CA05-kNN/raw/master/movies_recommendation_data.csv")

# Code

Python Notebook: 
("https://github.com/dhimansarkar18/K-Nearest-Neighbor-Recommender-Model/blob/main/KNN_Recommender_Model.ipynb")

# Instructions on How to Launch
 - I. Open the python notebook on google colab. 
 - II. Read the Movies Reccomendation Dataset
 - III. Run the Code 
 - IV. Generating 5 movies similar to the vovie "The Post"
							
# Procedures

 - I. Importing Packages 
 - II. Reading the Dataset
 - III. Data Exploration
 - IV. Data Cleaning and Processing
 - V. KNN Model (K Nearest Neighbors): Recommendation System
